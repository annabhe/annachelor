        Who are the other non-playable characters? Are there any you would date instead of the main lead?
    </h3>
    <div class="npcBio">
        <h4>The Main Lead</h4>
        <p>
            The Main Lead currently helps his/her mom run the family bakery. Growing up, he/she often hand-sewed bags to sell in the bakery to help the family business. 
            He/She also donated any winnings from his/her competitive bowling career to help renovate the bakery at home. 
            After his/her dad died at a young age on a fishing trip, The Main Lead saw how lonely his/her mother often was. 
            He/she wants to find love so he/she will never be lonely like this. Also, maybe he/she planned to promote his family’s bakery on the show. 
            Candidly, Chad didn’t really want to be the lead but needed to promote the family bakery so it wouldn’t get bought out by The Cookie Conglomerate.

        <h4>Jenevieve Script</h4>
        <p>
            Aries. Jenevieve discovered a passion for jumping headfirst when she was born with her head first. 
            She funnelled that passion into a career as a professional diver. 
            In addition to finding love, she hopes that by appearing on the show, she can find some more sponsors for the next Summer Olympic trials. 
            Possibly an adrenaline junkie and would definitely enjoy a skydiving date. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="npcBio">
        <h4>Elina Barby</h4>
        <p>
            Elina is a Taurus baby that was actually trying to apply for admission at a flying academy but clicked an ad and didn't realise her mistake.
            Unfortunately, she's too stubborn to admit her mistake and now is being forced to follow through. Elina, like most human people, was born without wings.
            Despite that, she has often had dreams about being a fairy and hanging around an unlikable mermaid. 
            Hence, she desperately wants to fly to literally live her dream. She has a pet hamster named Bibble who enjoys eating berries and singing.   
        </p>

    <div class="npcBio">
        <h4>Serene Poke</h4>
        <p>
            Serene is the twin sister to Grace Mon but took their mother's last name. She is a great adventurer and enjoys wandering in places she is unfamiliar with. 
            In fact, she won her spot on this show because she accidentally wandered on set during the proposal last season. Fortunately, the main lead realised before the proposal. 
            Serene is a jack of all trades and shines in almost every situation. If the main lead had truly proposed to her by accident, she probably would've accepted. 
            It's no wonder she impressed the judges on her audition for this show.  
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="npcBio">
        <h4>Grace Mon</h4>
        <p>
            Grace is the twin sister to Serene Poke but took their father's surname. She is also adventurous like her sister but prefers adventuring in the kitchen with different foods than in the open wilderness. 
            She lives by the "fake it 'til you make it" mantra and has had many mishaps in the kitchen and maybe even started a few fires. 
            Fortunately, her special skill is being able to bullshit her way out of any situation so she managed to get away scot free even when she was caught cooking in someone else's home????
            When she found out Serene was auditioning for the show, she childishly had to do it also. It's unclear whether having twins on a national dating show is a good idea.  
        </p>

    <div class="npcBio">
        <h4>Astrid Hickery</h4>
        <p>
            Astrid is a lumberjack and is incredibly skillful with an axe. She is often moody and emotionally sensitive. She has been accused by peers of taking everything personally, a statement she also took personally. 
            Luckily, she has found axes to be very calming and something that grounds her. As a child, she once dressed up as a viking for Halloween and now dresses like a viking every Halloween. 
            Astrid is smart but short-tempered and although holding an axe keeps her calm, it often makes those around her nervous. Hence, she prefers hanging around the trees anyway. 
        </p> 
    </div>
    <div class="npcBio">
        <h4>Meihua Blossom XIII</h4>
        <p>
            Meihua is the thirteenth daughter of a very skilled swordsman. She was training to inherit her father's swordsmanship skills when her mother suddenly died of illness and her father remarried.
            In true Cinderella fashion, she was swept aside and treated like cleaning staff in her own home. As a Leo, Meihua could not stand not being the center of attention and ran away from home. 
            Since then, she has found work as an assassin in order to continue honing her swordsmanship as well as keep her ego in check. Her target on this show may not actually be a love target but rather...
            Hopefully, she can (can't?) keep her ego in check amidst all the cameras to carry out her intended task.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="npcBio">
        <h4>Restuko Sanrio</h4>
        <p>
            Just an average office lady in her late twenties who is struggling with the monotony of becoming an adult. One of her favorite pastimes is singing at a karaoke with close friends. She almost always carries her own microphone with her. 
            Retsuko is possibly the most relatable contestant to the viewers this season. Except for the part where she dated a multimillionaire and also briefly became a Japanese pop idol. 
            But with that behind her, she is looking to find love so she can quit her boring accounting job and become a housewife. 
            In other news, Retsuko recently got her driver's license! Yes for vehicular freedommmmmmm.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="npcBio">
        <h4>Naegi Peacherson</h4>
        <p>
            An incredibly underwhelming man with little to no presence. He is incredibly average and won his spot on the show via lottery. He often repeats what he says because he can't think of anything else to say. 
            He is compulsively clean and often cleans up after others, whether it's after a meal, after an emotional breakdown, or after a recent murder. 
            Despite seeming tedious, Naegi finds the rhythmic motions of cleaning to be therapeutic and calming. He is looking for someone he can spend time cleaning up after. 
            It would make more sense for him to simply start a housecleaning service. Naegi seeks order in life and often wonders whether life is just a simulation after all. 
        </p>

    <div class="npcBio">
        <h4>Zeke Lelda</h4>
        <p>
            Zeke is a freelance yoga instructor that can never make up his mind about anything. Between his core values of wisdom, courage, and power, he often feels compelled to weigh all the options to make the decision with maximum balance and harmony. 
            Zeke has always struggled in love because of his hesitancy to commit. He was a last-minute addition to this cast despite being one of the first contestants offered a spot. 
            In addition to yoga, Zeke's part time hobbies also include swordfighting, archery, and horseback riding. His favorite color is green. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="npcBio">
        <h4>Neil Anamai</h4>
        <p> 
            Neil has a really intense and often pessimistic view about humanity and the human race. His background is fairly unknown but is very knowledgeable about astronomy and space. 
            Neil claims to be a big sci-fi fan and attributes that to his ramblings about space travel but some of it is suspiciously specific. His favorite author is Douglas Adams, and is a big fan of his trilogy of five.
            Neil became interested in the show after it was marketed as a "social experiment."
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="npcBio">
        <h4>Alphonse Dente</h4>
        <p> 
            Alphonse "Al" Dente is a big pasta guy. He loves all types of pasta although it's not  clear he knows what the word pasta actually means. Whatever, as long as it's a carb that you can boil and eat, it's probably pasta.
            (Not sure about that Al, but you do you.) His love for pasta started with macaroni and ravioli but when he fell in love with Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal he faced a conundrum of loving something that wasn't pasta for the first time ever.
            Confused, Al chose to adapt by simply expanding the limits and borders of what "pasta" is. He owns a food truck to bring pasta to everyone everywhere and is hoping being on this show will help him land some new gigs.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="npcBio">
        <h4>Mapo Futo</h4>
        <p>
            Mapo Futo is a spiritual vegan who isn't really a fan of soybeans but hates animal cruelty even more. 
            His life goal is to transcend everyday reality, often with the aid of some cocktail beverages. 
            His work travelling to parallel universes is incredibly taxing and he often retreats to his room to sleep and rest.
            He auditioned for the show after finding out who the main lead is. His goal is to convince the main lead to eliminate the use of animal products at their family bakery. And to enjoy the free bar. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="npcBio">
        <h4>Phoenix Naruhodo</h4>
        <p>
            Phoenix is a defense attorney but often works overtime as detective to find evidence to prove his clients' innocence. He seems to have an intimate relationship with death as his clients are generally accused of murder. 
            He is often accompanied by a spiritual medium who generally follows him around and occasionally summons other attorneys from beyond the grave to help him during trial.
            It seems Phoenix did not actually audition for a spot on this show but was hired by a different contestant in anticipation of a potential assassination attempt and murder trial.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="npcBio">
        <h4>Thomas Nookington</h4>
        <p>
            Thomas "Tom" Nookington is a cold and hyper-rational real estate mogul. He manages real estate on several islands that he owns  and employs his nephews to run a monopolistic general store franchise on these islands. 
            Most recently, he has wanted to begin leasing office space for a certain Cookie Conglomerate. 
            Unfortunately, the head of Cookie Conglomerate is unwilling to partner with Tom until a few more bakeries fall within its grasp. The Cookie Conglomerate has already put a plan in motion to "persuade" these remaining bakeries but has not disclosed what this plan is. 
            Instead, the Cookie Conglomerate head instructed Tom to attend this game show and "stand by." Tom did not audition for his spot but bribed his way in.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="npcBio">
        <h4>Ferdinand von Aegir</h4>
        <p>
            Ferdinand is a proud nobleman who is courageous and competitive. He is always striving to improve his skills and talents for his own sake. 
            He didn't really audition and isnt actually here for love but was rather hired by a different contestant as a bodyguard. 
            Ferdinand likes horseback riding, tea, and being noble. He dislikes slothfulness and nobles who are not noble.
