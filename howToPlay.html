        Can you win the heart of the main lead in six weeks? Compete against 14 other non-playable characters to see who can win the final rose!
    </h3>
    <h4>General Gameplay</h4>
    <p>
        There are six weeks in the game and thus, six rounds of elimination. Each week you have three days to take action.
        You can either Boost your Charm Stat, Incite Drama, Ask the lead on a Date, Socialize, or Sleep the day away. 
        Boosting your charm stat will increase your charm anywhere from two to eight points. 
        Asking the lead for a date does not guarantee that you will receive a date. The less competitors you have, the more likely the lead will accept your date request.
        The exception is during the final two weeks of your Journey. During Fantasy Suite Week and Finale Week, you MUST go on a date. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of each week is the Rose Ceremony where the lead will distribute roses to the contestants with the highest charm stats.
        If you do not have a rose by the end of the Ceremony, you will be eliminated and lose the game.
        No fear! You can always restart and play again. 
    </p>
    <h4>Boosting Charm</h4>
    <p>
        Charm is how the Main Lead will decide whether to keep you at the Rose Ceremony. Make sure to take time each week to boost your charm!
    </p>
    <h4>Inciting Drama</h4>
    <p>
        If you choose to incite drama among the contestants, it's possible that you could lower the charm of everyone else!
        However, you may also end up losing your own charm points. Or maybe your senseless problems will simply be ignored. 
    </p>
    <h4>Date Gameplay</h4>
    <p>
        During the date, the main lead will make a statement and it is up to you to respond with the reaction that he or she is looking for. 
        Pick wisely! If you react appropriately, the lead will reward you with a rose! 
        That means you are guaranteed to pass the upcoming Rose Ceremony, even if your charm stat is far behind the other contestants.
        Does that mean you could win the show even with zero Charm...? Hmm...
    </p>
    <h4>Socialise</h4>
    <p>
        Of course, you're not the only contestant here to win the Main Lead's heart. 
        In between dates and Rose Ceremonies, you can take time to get to know the others in the house! Find a new BFF!
    </p>
    <h4>Sleep</h4>
    <p>
        Take a break! Nothing will happen and the day will advance.
